# Pigs in Space Netlogo Model

This model was made to simulate movement of wild boars in a city of Haifa using Netlogo software (Wilensky 1999). More information about this model and research behind it can be found in Toger et al. (2018). The model is also uploaded to the [Modelling Commons](http://modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/6646).

To run the model download `PigsInSpace_model_2share` folder. It contains the model and some example data files in ascii form. To load the data use setup type "Haifa" and select which neighbourhood you wish to run in "data_File" setting. The model uses the GIS extention of Netlogo to load the spatial environment. If you want to avoid that and run a synthetic environment - change setup type to "scenario3".
